I am a Front-End Web Developer. I am passionately curious about learning and writing code. I am a quick learner which is my strength. Besides, I am always curious to explore new technologies and can easily adapt to any new technologies. Gradually, I have been improving my interpersonal skills and my strategic thinking. Now I am searching for a remote job (full-time/intern) in a reputed company where I can apply my skill and collaborate on the company's success. And also gather knowledge from real-world projects.
